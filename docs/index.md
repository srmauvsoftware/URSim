<div style="text-align: justify"> You have arrived at the documentation of URSim - an open source 3D underwater simulation framework for Unmanned Underwater Vehicles (UUVs) developed using Robotics Operating System (ROS) and a real-time game engine called Unity3D. <br><br>URSim provides the user an intuitive way to simulate underwater vehicles and robots. The software architecture is adaptive to algorithms for control systems, image processing, navigation and manipulation. </div><br> Our paper - Simulator for Unmanned Underwater Vehicles using ROS and Unity3D to be presented at UT'19 IEEE-OES conference on April 17 '19
